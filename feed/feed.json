They also work perfectly well with steak as we're using here, and often served with boiled potatoes, corn on the cob and a sauce made from aji amarillo (a key ingredient in Peruvian cuisine). The aji amarillo chilli is fairly mild, but has a lovely rich, fruity flavour and is used here in both the marinade and accompanying salsa.</p>",

Warming Indian spices help to make this chunky soup ideal for colder months, and light cream cheese gives it that indulgent, creamy taste without tons of extra calories. It\u2019s a great way to use up any chicken that you might have left over from your Sunday lunch!</p>",

It is thought to have been first created in the Ottoman Empire when Turkish soldiers, forced to camp in tents, grill their food over wood outside. I like to use the rosemary stems for vegetable kebabs. They add so much flavour. You should marinate the vegetable lamb kebabs first and, if possible, grill them over dried herbs to improve the taste even more.</p>",

You can see the influence of the Moors (the North African colonisers of Spain for several centuries), in the use of cumin and chilli in the slightly spicy seasoning of these skewers and the mojo picon sauce on the side, but the use or pork and garlic allioli roots them very much in modern Spain.</p>",

This is a very quick and easy recipe to make once you have your tapenade and tomato sauce. This tapenade can be made with black or green olives, but this dish looks dramatic with the pork coated in either colour, surrounded by the red tomato sauce. The tapenade stores for up to a week in the refrigerator but can also be stored in the freezer.</p>",
