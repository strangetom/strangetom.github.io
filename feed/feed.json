Mild green chillies lend their heat and green beans and coriander lend their fresh green bite to this family favourite. This makes eight generous fishcakes, which could serve four as a main course, or eight as a starter. Serve with a tangle of salad and some mayonnaise or yoghurt raita, with lemon wedges for squeezing.</p>",

Put your inner-sceptic on hold and try this gorgeous salad. I add a touch of Cajun spice to the prawns for a bolder flavour and the whole thing just sings.</p>",

This lovely chicken recipe features the subtle earthy, lemon flavour of coriander seeds and not the punch of the leaves, which some people have an aversion to. When I first designed this dish, I was aiming for a Cantonese-style lemon chicken, but it has evolved into something different again, Sabrina style. Not only is it flavourful, it\u2019s pretty simple to throw together, and great served with rice.</p>",
