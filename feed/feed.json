There\u2019s broccoli and spinach for added greens and a wonderful savoury note from the bacon. Feel free to use any cheese you have left over in the fridge; blue cheese or cheddar would work well.</p>",

You can, of course, use fresh corn kernels cut from a cob, but using frozen is easiest. Serve with some crusty bread, at room temperature or straight from the bubbling pot.</p>",

Let\u2019s just say it was the perfect welcoming gesture that kept them friendly and kind for the duration of our relationship.</p>",
