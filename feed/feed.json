This lovely chicken recipe features the subtle earthy, lemon flavour of coriander seeds and not the punch of the leaves, which some people have an aversion to. When I first designed this dish, I was aiming for a Cantonese-style lemon chicken, but it has evolved into something different again, Sabrina style. Not only is it flavourful, it\u2019s pretty simple to throw together, and great served with rice.</p>",

It was a yearly tradition to celebrate this green wonder at a sagra, or local festival, near Naples. When I was a kid, I would eagerly await this fair, as it meant there would be endless fried broccoli rabe available. Walking around town holding a panino with sausage and broccoli rabe was as delightful and exciting to me as going on the merry-go-rounds or roller coaster rides that flooded the sagra. Needless to say, when my Pugliese stepmother, Angela, introduced me to this dish, it quickly became one of my favorites.</p>",

We wanted an extra-cheesy sausage lasagna that was full of all the flavors of Italian sausage and that held up structurally when served (rather than slipping into a flat mess on the plate like so many others). To make quick work of breaking down the aromatic base of our sausage and tomato sauce, we pulsed fennel, onion, sage, garlic, fennel seeds, and pepper flakes in the food processor, which easily cut the ingredients into small pieces that would soften in the sauce. Next, we boiled our lasagna noodles, slightly undercooking them so that they didn\u2019t turn mushy when they were baked. Then, we puzzled out a precise layering technique to ensure a structurally sound lasagna. By cutting two of the boiled noodles in half, we were able to provide full coverage in the dish for the lower layers of the lasagna (most noodles aren\u2019t quite as long as the baking dish). For the cheesy element, we turned to a combo of creamy mozzarella, flavorful provolone, and supersavory Pecorino Romano. Finally, at the risk of insulting home cooks who have been making their families\u2019 long-established lasagna recipes, we found that we preferred cottage cheese to the traditional ricotta for the creamy element in this lasagna. Ricotta can become gritty, dry, and pasty when baked, while cottage cheese contains more moisture and is more apt to stay pillowy-soft and creamy.</p>",
