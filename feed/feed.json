It is served with eggy bread, frig\u0103nele, which is a good trick to make a meal more substantial. The aroma that brings everything together is dill, and I know many of you have a love-hate relationship with it, but we love it in Romania. Dill and garden peas are meant to be together. Try it at least once in this combination.</p>",

I tested the recipe with salmon for practical reasons and the result was very good. It is a dish that can be served on its own as a starter or with drinks, or as a main course with potatoes and salad.</p>",

To accommodate the filling, the baguette should be approximately 18 inches long, 3 inches wide, and at least 2 inches tall. A ciabatta of similar size will work, as will individual ciabatta rolls. You can substitute 1 tablespoon of oregano for the marjoram and kalamata olives for the ni\u00e7oise.</p>",
