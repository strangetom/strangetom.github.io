Don\u2019t be intimidated by the long cooking time here \u2013 it\u2019s mostly a waiting game once the pot goes into the oven, so it can easily be put together in the afternoon, ready for a decadent dinner.</p>",

We love making it on the boat because the ingredients are simple and readily available, yet the flavor is fresh and tangy. Red curry paste (we used store-bought) brings the broth to life with its red chilies, coriander, lemongrass, garlic, and shallots. This soup is tasty made with salmon, halibut, rockfish, or shrimp\u2014or throw in a combination! You can double the recipe for a big pot that will last you all week and add fresh garnishes to each bowl you enjoy. When we\u2019re fishing in Prince William Sound during the summer, we like to add fresh spot prawns that we caught and serve the soup over steaming white rice for an even heartier meal.</p>",

This is undeniably one of the best, with bacon and paprika turning the flavours up a notch, making sure every spoonful is rich, smoky and satisfying. The store-cupboard ingredients help keep costs down \u2013 and we\u2019ve included 3 different methods, so that this recipe is ready on a timescale that suits you!</p>",

The celeriac adds freshness, and there\u2019s pepper from the watercress \u2013 perfect. You can easily cook the eggs in the tin for the last 10 minutes, as with the roast potato hash here, but I prefer the look and texture of soft-boiled eggs with this.</p>",
