This is my twist on the classic roast pork with apple sauce, but packing in a lot more flavour and giving every bite a sticky appeal that leaves you wanting more. It\u2019s great served with rice, or in a bun with pickled cucumbers.</p>",

They also work perfectly well with steak as we're using here, and often served with boiled potatoes, corn on the cob and a sauce made from aji amarillo (a key ingredient in Peruvian cuisine). The aji amarillo chilli is fairly mild, but has a lovely rich, fruity flavour and is used here in both the marinade and accompanying salsa.</p>",
