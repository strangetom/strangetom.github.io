For us, this dish is synonymous with many places in Bombay: Olympia Coffee House and Caf\u00e9 Paris on Colaba Causeway, and Radio Restaurant behind Crawford Market (supposedly where the local Muslim gangsters hang out). A good dish of this keema is guaranteed to transport us back to these places.</p>",

Sassanian in Dhobi Talao serves the best ones with mutton, chicken and vegetable variations.\n\nThese keema puffs will be very good with a little tamarind chutney or even chilli chutney, but in Bombay you would eat them with good old tomato ketchup.\n\nMake sure the filling is completely cold before you assemble the puffs, other wise the pastry will be difficult to handle.</p>",

Traditionally made with dill seeds and the roasted red tahini of the city, my version uses caraway seeds and toasted sesame oil, both more readily available in Western supermarkets. Of course, if you happen to come across the former ingredients, don\u2019t hesitate to use them for a more authentic version. In Gaza this is often served at room temperature with warm bread. The accompaniments are up to you; I like it with steamed rice or\u2014if I need something a little more comforting\u2014a generous portion of creamy mashed potato. This tastes even better the next day, so is a great make-ahead dish.</p>",
