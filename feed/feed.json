This pasta dish is a case in point \u2013 easy, quick and satisfying, perfect for a midweek meal. It also works well with fresh oregano instead of sage; either way, the gently infused herb butter really does make the dish.</p>",

A generous squeeze of lemon juice, along with a scattering of fresh dill and feta cheese, elevates this dish from weeknight meat and potatoes to dinner-party fare. While the chicken will still be delicious if marinated for just 30 minutes, marinating it for several hours will yield the best results.</p>",

Even in Iran, due to our close proximity to Russia, we enjoy a good stroganoff. \u2018Always with thin, matchstick fries,\u2019 says my mother, as she recounts her memories from her youth in Tehran. I\u2019ve had some really good stroganoffs in my time, from a fantastic one in St Petersburg served with mashed potato, to versions with noodles, and the British interpretation with rice. Each recipe differed wildly and came in various shades from brown and beige to neon orange. This is a simplified version of the classic, and I\u2019ve used meatballs just because they work really well and taste fantastic in the mushroom sauce, making it very nearly as good as the traditional beef steak, served with french fries.</p>",
