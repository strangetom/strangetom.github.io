While Hazan instructs to remove the onion, so it merely infuses the tomato sauce, I like a stronger onion flavour and so, in my recipe, the onion is grated, melting into the other ingredients over the course of time. This recipe is simple and clean, allowing the short list of ingredients to do all the talking.</p>",

It\u2019s so handy and versatile, as it can be sliced and stuffed into pitta bread or wraps and sandwiches for lunchboxes, shredded and added to salads, or used in stir-fries or rice noodle dishes. But it also pairs perfectly with steamed rice or naan in the same way tandoori chicken does. You can also marinate the chicken up to 48 hours in advance, or freeze the marinated raw chicken for use at a later date or for batch cooking.</p>",

I loved the dish so much that I developed a version with prawns that I often make at home.</p>",

Admittedly, this is not the world\u2019s best-kept secret, as over the years I have written many kebab recipes using every kind of meat. This is my go-to when I want good value and quick, easy results. Lamb neck is completely underrated, especially for quick cooking, although it is equally good for slow-cooked dishes. Once you try this recipe, I know it will become as firm a favourite of yours as it is mine. Serve in wraps or warmed pitta bread with yogurt, sliced onion, tomato, pickled cucumber and coriander leaves, or on a bed of mixed leaves with pomegranate seeds and a good drizzle of pomegranate molasses.</p>",
