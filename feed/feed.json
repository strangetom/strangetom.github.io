It's simple: no new ingredients, tools or technology needed. You don't even need stale bread. What you do need is thick-cut white bread, dunked into an egg-milk mixture with extra richness from egg yolks and heavy cream. That gives the French toast a buttery taste and firm but fluffy texture.</p>",
