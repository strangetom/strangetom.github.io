The sweetness that the ginger beer brings is also wonderful when offset with the pungent, savoury hit of the English mustard. You could use wholegrain or Dijon if you prefer, both of which would give a slightly tart edge to the dish that would also be very welcome.</p>",

In which case, this recipe is perfect. Made out of tinned carrots and flavoured to the nines, this simple sauce is stirred through with pasta, peas and prawns. It\u2019s bright and delicious, but most of all, quick!</p>",

You can choose from lamb, beef or merguez sausage, or even have a meat feast and mix all three. It\u2019s the ultimate speedy snack.</p>",
