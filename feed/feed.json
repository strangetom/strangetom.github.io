Over the course of time, Sicily was invaded by many different cultures, leading to a melting pot of influences across their culinary repertoire. Here, rich fatty pork is married with sweet and sour flavours as well as a touch of north African spice.</p>",

Humble and comforting, the two come together to create a meal in itself. Here the jammy peppers and herby avocado take the whole thing up a notch (or three). If serving this as a side, it pairs really well with the spicy rotisserie chicken bake. </p>",
