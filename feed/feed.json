One of her go-to weekday dishes was pasta baked with meatballs bound together with melted cheese. There\u2019s a big controversy in Italy about pasta and meatballs. It\u2019s not typical in most of its fiercely regional cuisines so many Italians write it off as a purely American invention. After all, spaghetti (a first course) and meatballs (a second course) are traditionally served separately. Still, I know for a fact that many families, including mine, have gone against the grain and served pasta with meatballs for generations. All over the south of Italy and in parts of Abruzzo, nonne bake trays of pasta studded with tiny meatballs, proving that the combination does indeed exist!</p>",

These pancakes combine some of my favourite ingredients in every mouthful, and what is really lovely about them is how convivial they are, ideal for feasting and sharing where everyone can make their own combinations and enjoy them without you having to plate them up individually.</p>",

Their bacon naans, generously stuffed with chunky, crispy bacon and a spicy-sweet sauce, are absolutely epic. This is my humble homage to the great bacon naan of Dishoom \u2013 a wonderful bacon sandwich at any time of day.</p>",
