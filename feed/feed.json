This dish is native to Bahrain and is locally called \u2018tikka\u2019, but is not really tikka as we know it to be. Grilled to order, the tikka comes wrapped up in a little flatbread bundle with raw onion, local rocket (called \u2018jarjeer\u2019) and lime wedges to squeeze on top. Be sure to source meat with some fat attached \u2013 this truly adds to the whole authentic eating experience. We urge you to give this marinade a go, if not with beef then with lamb, chicken, tofu or meaty mushrooms. Serve this with the roasted potatoes with a\u00efoli (see recipe).</p>",
