This is undeniably one of the best, with bacon and paprika turning the flavours up a notch, making sure every spoonful is rich, smoky and satisfying. The store-cupboard ingredients help keep costs down \u2013 and we\u2019ve included 3 different methods, so that this recipe is ready on a timescale that suits you!</p>",

The celeriac adds freshness, and there\u2019s pepper from the watercress \u2013 perfect. You can easily cook the eggs in the tin for the last 10 minutes, as with the roast potato hash here, but I prefer the look and texture of soft-boiled eggs with this.</p>",

BBQ seasoning and sweet smoked paprika makes a gorgeous, smoky-flavoured sauce that\u2019ll transform one pack of mince into a batch-cookable family favourite. Enjoy it with the fun of twisting spaghetti around your fork or serve it with any pasta shape \u2013 you won\u2019t regret wiping your plate clean with some crusty garlic bread \u2026</p>",

This speedy pasta dish brings so much flavour to the table, no one will guess how easy it is to make. It turns tinned white crabmeat into a dinner that tastes just as good as restaurant versions, for a fraction of the calories. We\u2019d say this recipe is medium hot, thanks to leaving the seeds in our red chilli, but you can add more or less to make it right for you.</p>",

You can easily stick to this spirit, even if you lose the lamb, and serve the gratin as part of a Chinese-ish vegetable feast with our cucumber salad \u00e0 la Xi\u2019an Impression, steamed aubergines with charred chilli salsa and sweet and sour sprouts with chestnuts and grapes.\nIdeally, you want to cut the potatoes thinly using a mandolin or a food processor with the appropriate attachment. Don\u2019t worry if you have neither, though \u2013 cutting them by hand is also fine; you might just need to cook them a little longer if they are thicker than 3mm. You can bake the gratin the day before and reheat it in a very hot oven just before serving if you want to get ahead. Top with the aromatics and zest just as you serve, and not before.</p>",
