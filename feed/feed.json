My ten-year-old eats it by the trayful. It is a dish you will want to cook again and again, putting it on the table with a modest air, knowing that it will be a knockout. A red wine and a crisp green salad is a fine match.</p>",

Traditionally it would be served with chips or roasted potatoes and a pile of saffron rice.</p>",

Frozen mince is often not super lean, which is perfect for this as no extra liquid is added to the mix, so a little natural fat keeps the topping from drying out. I like to use Greek-style flatbreads (and generally have a pack in the freezer for emergencies), but you could use pita breads too, if that\u2019s what you happen to have to hand.</p>",

The honey and gochujang caramelize into a spicy, sweet and salty crust around the potatoes, which go into the oven first. Then, when the salmon steaks and broccoli go on top, the juices from the fish mix with the caramelized bits, creating a delicious self-saucing dish that you\u2019ll come back to again and again!</p>",
