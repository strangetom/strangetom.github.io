There are various tales as to why this particular name is given to this snack: one is that the white bread represents the white dress of the bride wrapped around a dark tuxedo (typically a lamb filling) of the groom in a deep embrace (!). Thinking slightly more practically, for those with an appetite arayes are essentially pan-fried pita bread sandwiches. They\u2019re great either for snacking on before a meal or as a meal in themselves, served with a fresh chopped salad and some sumac yoghurt. </p>",

It\u2019s light and airy, but the chocolate rubble is a masterstroke because every bite is different as the chocolate ratio changes throughout the cake. Try it! You won\u2019t be disappointed.</p>",

Ordinarily we would only ever cook lamb on the bone, and hence in Mowgli we add marrow bones in for the long simmer. A luxurious richness is brought with the aromatic spicings and I added a sweet headiness by including ground anise and prunes, which turn to a thick, sweet mass in the pan. I love using rotis to mop up the deep, sweet juices.</p>",

The green sauce is intense and punchy; perfect with fish, it\u2019s also fantastic spooned over lamb or chicken.</p>",
