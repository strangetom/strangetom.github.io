Today, bastillas have evolved to include chicken, quail and seafood varieties. My seafood bastillas are delicious served with the rich tomato and garlic sauce.</p>",

Mild green chillies lend their heat and green beans and coriander lend their fresh green bite to this family favourite. This makes eight generous fishcakes, which could serve four as a main course, or eight as a starter. Serve with a tangle of salad and some mayonnaise or yoghurt raita, with lemon wedges for squeezing.</p>",

Put your inner-sceptic on hold and try this gorgeous salad. I add a touch of Cajun spice to the prawns for a bolder flavour and the whole thing just sings.</p>",
