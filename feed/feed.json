Soft-boiled eggs are a welcome addition, but feel free to leave out the egg and use a yoghurt alternative if you want to keep things vegan.</p>",

We use store-bought berbere spice, but you can also toast and grind your own homemade blend, especially if you have a well-stocked spice rack. We love this for being a complete meal in a tray, but wouldn\u2019t say no to a big ol\u2019 bowl of greens to eat alongside.</p>",
