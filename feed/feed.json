Korokke are mashed potato patties with chunky bits of onion and ground meat mixed in, covered with a crispy shell of panko bread crumbs. I tweaked the tradi\u00adtional recipe and swapped the meat for tempeh crumbles. Tempeh crumbles gain an irresistibly rich flavor once you cook them in oil and soy sauce, and I bet even traditional korokke lovers won\u2019t notice the difference.</p>",
