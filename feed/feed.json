I often buy jars of ready roasted red peppers, then don\u2019t know what to do with them \u2013 this is a perfect way to use them up. You can use any cheese you have lying about \u2013 I like the contrast of blue cheese with this, but feta or goat\u2019s cheese would be just as good.</p>",

Use good-quality sausages, as the texture works really well here and you\u2019ll need the added seasoning from them.</p>",

There\u2019s broccoli and spinach for added greens and a wonderful savoury note from the bacon. Feel free to use any cheese you have left over in the fridge; blue cheese or cheddar would work well.</p>",
