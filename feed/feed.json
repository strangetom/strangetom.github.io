Coated in golden panko breadcrumbs, they\u2019re so easy and satisfying to make. You can crisp them up in the oven or in your air fryer and serve as a tasty snack or side dish.</p>",

My mom really loves whiskey and would often cook with it, infusing her dishes with the amazing earthy flavor of the liquor. I sometimes cook with whiskey, too, like in this boozy homage to my mother. I spike the pan with it just as I would with vodka for penne alla vodka (see my version of this, The Lady in Pink), transferring the woody notes of the whiskey to the cream. The dish feels wintery to me, and I imagine eating it by a fireplace while on a vacation in the Scottish Highlands, or anywhere chilly really. The smoked salmon soaks up the cream with its flavor and makes a gorgeous pink cloak for the penne.</p>",

It is served with eggy bread, frig\u0103nele, which is a good trick to make a meal more substantial. The aroma that brings everything together is dill, and I know many of you have a love-hate relationship with it, but we love it in Romania. Dill and garden peas are meant to be together. Try it at least once in this combination.</p>",

I tested the recipe with salmon for practical reasons and the result was very good. It is a dish that can be served on its own as a starter or with drinks, or as a main course with potatoes and salad.</p>",
