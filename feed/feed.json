This dish is native to Bahrain and is locally called \u2018tikka\u2019, but is not really tikka as we know it to be. Grilled to order, the tikka comes wrapped up in a little flatbread bundle with raw onion, local rocket (called \u2018jarjeer\u2019) and lime wedges to squeeze on top. Be sure to source meat with some fat attached \u2013 this truly adds to the whole authentic eating experience. We urge you to give this marinade a go, if not with beef then with lamb, chicken, tofu or meaty mushrooms. Serve this with the roasted potatoes with a\u00efoli (see recipe).</p>",

The flavours work a treat with a fresh lime crust contrasting really will with a delicious sweet potato. This is one to freestyle with and try different flavour combos. It works great in the oven or cooked on a BBQ.</p>",
