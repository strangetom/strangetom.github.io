This sandwich is a classic \u2013 minced meat cooked on a hot plate with onions, herbs and spices, and served with masses of chilli sauce in a soft, white roll. You can choose from lamb, beef or merguez sausage, or even have a meat feast and mix all three. It\u2019s the ultimate speedy snack.</p>",

The potatoes soak up all the spices as they cook gently in the sauce, and a drizzle of harissa oil gives a killer kick at the end. Traditionally this humble dish would be served with bread and fried fish from the souk. I enjoy it just as it is for a simple mid-week supper.</p>",
