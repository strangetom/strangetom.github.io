The skin does not turn quite as crisp as it does when cooked the conventional way, seared first in a frying pan on the stove, but it is delicious nonetheless.</p>",

Along with frozen peppers and sheets of pastry, thyme is one of those freezer essentials (hardy herbs freeze really well) which can be brought out to add a lovely scent to a simple tart such as this.</p>",
