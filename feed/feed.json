So much so that when the women in my family gathered around me to cook for me before my wedding day, as is tradition, this is what I requested. I've opted for boneless white fish fillets here, but traditionally it is cooked with the very bony but delicious Hilsa fish, and you can always spot a true Bengali by the way they can navigate their way around the bones!</p>",

Many of North India's most famous dishes have their roots here, with the sophisticated use of fragrant spices and expensive ingredients such as dairy and nuts. Reshmi (from  the Hindu word for silk, a reference their tender texture) are famed for their rich flavour and the longer you marinate the kebabs the more delicious they get - so if you have time marinate them for a full 24 hours for the most succulent texture.</p>",

Thin slices of breadcrumbed veal, layered up with tomato sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan, then baked, ticks all the boxes for a hearty, tasty feast. If you prefer, swap the veal for chicken breasts bashed thin between sheets of clingfilm.</p>",

This is my twist on the classic roast pork with apple sauce, but packing in a lot more flavour and giving every bite a sticky appeal that leaves you wanting more. It\u2019s great served with rice, or in a bun with pickled cucumbers.</p>",
