Cooking the stew for the most part in the oven means you get lovely caramelized sausages as well as the occasional carrot or lentil tinged golden brown and crunchy from the all-round fierce heat of the oven. If you\u2019re counting the calories, you can use low-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or none at all), but I love how, when mixed with the mustard, it adds a silky indulgence with a bit of oomph to the dish!</p>",

Once they\u2019re very soft, I mix through a generous amount of fresh coriander (cilantro) and nothing more. And therein lies the inspiration for this recipe!</p>",

The recipe is super simple, you just need to let the oven do its work. Be patient though as the beans can take a good 3 hours to become beautifully creamy. And don\u2019t forget to soak your beans overnight before starting to cook!</p>",

The fact that it\u2019s super simple and that the magic at the heart of it comes from opening a tin of mango slices makes me even more proud of how achievable and truly delicious it is. It also works brilliantly with tinned gooseberries or rhubarb in lieu of the mango, if you prefer tart to sweet.</p>",
