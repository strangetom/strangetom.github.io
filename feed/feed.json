Delicious served alongside some fresh green vegetables, or even with a fluffy baked potato, they are super-hearty and comforting. They\u2019re ready in no time at all, which makes them the perfect choice for a midweek meal.</p>",

Wrapping this salmon up in parcels along with the greens and dressing means that each parcel is bursting with flavour and delicious cooking juices. It makes for a very quick and easy midweek meal.</p>",
