The latter is referred to as 'dry' noodles and Bak Chor Mee is a great example. This dish is of Southern China origin, and is popular in both Malaysia and Singapore. Over time it has evolved, and one of the changes is serving it with Sambal - a chilli-based sauce.</p>",

Lamb keema is always cooked with big aromatic spices that make it a very quick way to create dramatic flavours. Keema is also a wonderful vessel for any past-their-best vegetables or half-used tins that are lurking in the back of your fridge, a true more-is-more recipe.</p>",

If you can't get creamed coconut just double-up on the tinned. During the last moments of these exotic sunshine curries, I often throw a handful of roasted nuts to boost the salt and the beach-holiday feel. If you\u2019re not a fan of nuts or don\u2019t have any to hand, you can leave these out without any detriment to the dish.</p>",

It\u2019s also delicious with rice or noodles, and a fried egg on top makes it very nearly perfect. You can use any minced meat, but I do love pork and it allows the spicing to turn it the colour of warm summer sunshine.</p>",
