The recipe is super simple, you just need to let the oven do its work. Be patient though as the beans can take a good 3 hours to become beautifully creamy. And don\u2019t forget to soak your beans overnight before starting to cook!</p>",

The fact that it\u2019s super simple and that the magic at the heart of it comes from opening a tin of mango slices makes me even more proud of how achievable and truly delicious it is. It also works brilliantly with tinned gooseberries or rhubarb in lieu of the mango, if you prefer tart to sweet.</p>",

I have always felt at odds with the dish. It was the curry she made when she had nothing much in and a general lack of enthusiasm. It was one of the few bones of contention between us! This recipe is a little different to my mother\u2019s version. It\u2019s a simple dish, but sometimes an uncomplicated, everyday, filling curry is just what\u2019s needed, especially when the cupboards are a bit bare. It is easily doubled to serve more.</p>",

The apple is the real game changer here and it adds an interesting twist and a lovely bite to this superb traybake.</p>",
