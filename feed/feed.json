It\u2019s a dish to eat with your hands and with your friends, served from one pot or plate, for everyone to then tear at some of the bread and spoon over the chicken and topping for themselves.</p>",

The synthesis comes from Mexico\u2019s history, but perfection comes from the combination of sweet pineapple, spicy meat and fragrant corn. This recipe, from the chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara, provides an easy way to make it at home; try boneless chicken thighs if you don\u2019t want pork. Either way, make sure to blot the meat until very dry before cooking it so you get a hard sear that mimics the char of a grill. </p>",
