Made in the oven or slow cooker, you won\u2019t regret adding this to your midweek menu. Bulked out with vegetables and beans so the small joint of pork goes a long way, this one\u2019s great when you\u2019re watching your pennies as well as your calories. It\u2019s well worth batch-cooking and stashing away the leftovers for a rainy day.</p>",

It\u2019s the cherry on top, to lux out the meal for a special occasion \u2013 like the Seven Vegetables Couscous. Catering for the Moroccan sweet tooth, it should have bucket loads of sugar, but my palate (and my dentist) are not so keen. So my version omits all but a pinch of sugar, as I feel the sweetness of the onions is enough. I serve tfaya with a really simple chicken fry, flavoured with dry chermoula and cumin.</p>",

The sweetness that the ginger beer brings is also wonderful when offset with the pungent, savoury hit of the English mustard. You could use wholegrain or Dijon if you prefer, both of which would give a slightly tart edge to the dish that would also be very welcome.</p>",

In which case, this recipe is perfect. Made out of tinned carrots and flavoured to the nines, this simple sauce is stirred through with pasta, peas and prawns. It\u2019s bright and delicious, but most of all, quick!</p>",
