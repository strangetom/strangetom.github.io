Although most of them are made to accompany meat, I use the recipe with fish.</p>",

It\u2019s a Persian technique brought to the Balkans and north of the Danube by the Ottomans, who used it in meat dishes with beans, pulses and vegetables. In Romania, it is almost always a white bean stew without meat, although I found old recipes that used potatoes, peas and even octopus instead. I serve my iahnie with scovergi, fried cheese flatbreads with crispy edges and a gooey middle, for a more satisfying meal.</p>",

It bears a close resemblance to the classic Iranian noodle soup aash e reshteh, which leads me to believe that it found its way into the Palestinian kitchen during the time when the Persian empire ruled over the region 2,500 years ago. Whatever its history, it is a soup I make whenever I want to replenish depleted energy levels, or when I want to offer something restorative at the table, as it is packed with greens and healthy legumes. Feel free to substitute the linguine for another pasta, just be sure to adapt the cooking times according to the packet instructions of your noodle.</p>",

Capers, olives and anchovy often join the festivities; here they are combined with garlic and parsley to make a zesty salsa verde. Choose the best quality Italian or Spanish canned tuna\u2014the extra cost is well worth it. The other essential ingredient is freshly baked bread, like a good crisp baguette or crusty ciabatta roll.</p>",

Made in the oven or slow cooker, you won\u2019t regret adding this to your midweek menu. Bulked out with vegetables and beans so the small joint of pork goes a long way, this one\u2019s great when you\u2019re watching your pennies as well as your calories. It\u2019s well worth batch-cooking and stashing away the leftovers for a rainy day.</p>",

It\u2019s the cherry on top, to lux out the meal for a special occasion \u2013 like the Seven Vegetables Couscous. Catering for the Moroccan sweet tooth, it should have bucket loads of sugar, but my palate (and my dentist) are not so keen. So my version omits all but a pinch of sugar, as I feel the sweetness of the onions is enough. I serve tfaya with a really simple chicken fry, flavoured with dry chermoula and cumin.</p>",
