'Tahdig' is the Persian word referring to the bottom of the pot, where the rice forms a crunchy golden layer of crispy decadence. Also called 'socarrat' in Spain, this scorched rice is the part we look forward to the most.</p>",

Traditionally, they are served as a soup or with a locally made pasta called eriste, but tagliatelle works beautifully.</p>",

The Indian emperor Shah Jahan employed cooks from Persia who used huge volumes of saffron, dried nuts and dried fruits, as well as their signature steam-method that Persians still use to cook rice today. No dish of that era could be more famous than biryani, which is served all over India, Pakistan and the West. This version uses chicken breast, which because it is off the bone, cooks in half the time of a traditional biryani, so makes a great midweek supper.</p>",
