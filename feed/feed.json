While Hazan instructs to remove the onion, so it merely infuses the tomato sauce, I like a stronger onion flavour and so, in my recipe, the onion is grated, melting into the other ingredients over the course of time. This recipe is simple and clean, allowing the short list of ingredients to do all the talking.</p>",
