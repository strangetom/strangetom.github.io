It's essentially a tomato based soup that is made with meat, chickpeas and lentils, as well as a number of herbs and warming spices. Once cooked, the soup is thickened, and the result is a warmly spiced soup with a silky smooth texture and a chunky array of meat and legumes.</p>",

Topped with spicy minced lamb and herbs, they are great as a snack or a main meal. Making them in your own home isn\u2019t a chore at all and you can achieve pretty spectacular results. This is great family food, although hold back on a little of the spicing if not everyone likes chilli heat. </p>",
