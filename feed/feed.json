Her restaurant Quince in London's Mayfair is a fortress of delicious Eastern Mediterranean cuisine. It's a dish that requires a little attention to detail as the chicken must have a perfect seal or you will end up with butter all over the kitchen. Try not to double coat the chicken in the egg as it can make the dish a little soggy.</p>",
