He says: \u201cI love moules marini\u00e8res, but sometimes I want something that doesn\u2019t involve lots of pesky shell-wrangling to get at the delicious seafood within. This pasta sauce contains the same flavours, with the immense bonus that you can eat the shells!\u201d Find more of our weeknight, easy pasta recipes here.</p>",

You can grate the fresh ginger with a Microplane; you don\u2019t even need to peel it. The cake\u2019s sparkling, crispy top comes from a generous sprinkle of turbinado sugar, but it\u2019s also delicious with a bit of citrus or a chocolate glaze instead.</p>",

Ginger in its fresh form is something that instantly makes a chicken curry accessible and fresh. Agra street food stalls with their banana leaf bowls full of this bright red chicken curry leave me with fonder memories than the Taj Mahal itself.</p>",
