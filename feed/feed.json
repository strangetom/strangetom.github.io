Traditionally made with dill seeds and the roasted red tahini of the city, my version uses caraway seeds and toasted sesame oil, both more readily available in Western supermarkets. Of course, if you happen to come across the former ingredients, don\u2019t hesitate to use them for a more authentic version. In Gaza this is often served at room temperature with warm bread. The accompaniments are up to you; I like it with steamed rice or\u2014if I need something a little more comforting\u2014a generous portion of creamy mashed potato. This tastes even better the next day, so is a great make-ahead dish.</p>",

Although most of them are made to accompany meat, I use the recipe with fish.</p>",

It\u2019s a Persian technique brought to the Balkans and north of the Danube by the Ottomans, who used it in meat dishes with beans, pulses and vegetables. In Romania, it is almost always a white bean stew without meat, although I found old recipes that used potatoes, peas and even octopus instead. I serve my iahnie with scovergi, fried cheese flatbreads with crispy edges and a gooey middle, for a more satisfying meal.</p>",

It bears a close resemblance to the classic Iranian noodle soup aash e reshteh, which leads me to believe that it found its way into the Palestinian kitchen during the time when the Persian empire ruled over the region 2,500 years ago. Whatever its history, it is a soup I make whenever I want to replenish depleted energy levels, or when I want to offer something restorative at the table, as it is packed with greens and healthy legumes. Feel free to substitute the linguine for another pasta, just be sure to adapt the cooking times according to the packet instructions of your noodle.</p>",

Capers, olives and anchovy often join the festivities; here they are combined with garlic and parsley to make a zesty salsa verde. Choose the best quality Italian or Spanish canned tuna\u2014the extra cost is well worth it. The other essential ingredient is freshly baked bread, like a good crisp baguette or crusty ciabatta roll.</p>",
