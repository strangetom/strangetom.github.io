I always have spinach that needs using up in my fridge and curries such as this are tremendous at hiding it under a robe of distracting and delicious flavour and texture from veg-dodging children.</p>",

In this recipe, cherries and chestnuts impart their unmistakeable fruity sweetness on savoury lamb, buckwheat and fresh dill. Cooking the pilaf in the oven avoids any burnt bottoms and, I think, gives a nice crunch to the buckwheat at the surface of the dish.</p>",

As with pineapple upside-down cake, I think they are both.
