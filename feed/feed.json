The yogurt and lemon go a long way in helping to tenderise the meat and almost break down the structure so that the spices can better penetrate. Use mild paprika powder to give a good flavour and colour. In India they use chilli powder, which makes this dish seriously hot.</p>",

The scene in The Godfather where Pete Clemenza teaches Michael Corleone how to cook his meatball pasta has always held a grip on my heart, so much so that I recreated his recipe by playing the film over and over whilst I cooked along at the hob. I have to say the result was magnificent. So here it is for you because, as Clemenza says, \u201cYou never know, you might have to cook for 20 guys someday\u201d.</p>",

They are healthful and easy to prepare, require little time to cook and take well to all manner of spices. In this straightforward recipe, adapted from the New York chef Katy Sparks, you start with salmon fillets, liberally rub them on one side with a mixture of ground coriander, cloves, cumin and nutmeg, and then brown them in a very hot pan so the spices form a crust. Flip once, and that's it. For the best results, use fillets of equal sizes, cook them to medium rare, and use freshly ground spices. If you have only pre-ground, be sure they haven't gone stale sitting in your cabinet too long. (Yes, spices can go stale.)</p>",

But it wasn't until the 1970s and '80s, when restaurants started pairing the zesty sauce with breaded pieces of boneless chicken, that it became wildly popular. As a coating for chicken, honey mustard not only tastes great, but the acidity in the mustard helps keep the meat juicy. For hot honey mustard chicken tenders, add 1/2 teaspoon cayenne to the honey mustard. For an even quicker dinner, do steps 1 and 2 up to a day ahead. (Refrigerate the chicken and store the toasted panko at room temperature.) Eat the tenders dipped into barbecue sauce, hot sauce, ketchup, or -- you guessed it -- more honey mustard.</p>",
