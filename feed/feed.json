I wanted something delicious and substantial for those who didn\u2019t eat meat as well as those who did. This recipe went on to become a favourite at pop-up feasts in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. If butternut squash isn\u2019t your thing, it also works beautifully with other types of squash when in season.</p>",

My ten-year-old eats it by the trayful. It is a dish you will want to cook again and again, putting it on the table with a modest air, knowing that it will be a knockout. A red wine and a crisp green salad is a fine match.</p>",
