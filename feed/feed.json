The combination of Indian spices, European herbs and Latin American allspice and chilli is also really characteristic of Caribbean cooking and a legacy of the islands being something of a crossroads throughout history.</p>",

Try an Italian deli for these, if you can stretch to it. If not, it\u2019s a pretty tasty stew regardless.</p>",

The dish is inspired partly by Heidi Swanson\u2019s wild rice casserole, as well as a courgette gratin I learned to make early in my career. You can use pretty much any wholegrain cooked rice for this dish.</p>",

The kick of chilli, tingle of Sichuan pepper and gentle sweet-sour sauce form a typical Sichuanese combination of flavours and this delicious dish needs little more accompaniment than some plain rice and a simple smashed cucumber salad.</p>",
