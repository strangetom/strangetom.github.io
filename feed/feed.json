Cooking the stew for the most part in the oven means you get lovely caramelized sausages as well as the occasional carrot or lentil tinged golden brown and crunchy from the all-round fierce heat of the oven. If you\u2019re counting the calories, you can use low-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or none at all), but I love how, when mixed with the mustard, it adds a silky indulgence with a bit of oomph to the dish!</p>",
