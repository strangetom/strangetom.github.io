The fact that it\u2019s super simple and that the magic at the heart of it comes from opening a tin of mango slices makes me even more proud of how achievable and truly delicious it is. It also works brilliantly with tinned gooseberries or rhubarb in lieu of the mango, if you prefer tart to sweet.</p>",

I have always felt at odds with the dish. It was the curry she made when she had nothing much in and a general lack of enthusiasm. It was one of the few bones of contention between us! This recipe is a little different to my mother\u2019s version. It\u2019s a simple dish, but sometimes an uncomplicated, everyday, filling curry is just what\u2019s needed, especially when the cupboards are a bit bare. It is easily doubled to serve more.</p>",

This recipe breathes new life into canned tuna, canned tomatoes and dry pasta, making it is a great option when the fridge is bare. The apple is the real game changer here and it adds an interesting twist and a lovely bite to this superb traybake.</p>",

The yogurt and lemon go a long way in helping to tenderise the meat and almost break down the structure so that the spices can better penetrate. Use mild paprika powder to give a good flavour and colour. In India they use chilli powder, which makes this dish seriously hot.</p>",
