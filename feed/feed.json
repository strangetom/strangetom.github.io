The kick of chilli, tingle of Sichuan pepper and gentle sweet-sour sauce form a typical Sichuanese combination of flavours and this delicious dish needs little more accompaniment than some plain rice and a simple smashed cucumber salad.</p>",

The chicken is served two Cajun staples - a fiery hot sauce and dirty rice (a delicious concoction of rice, vegetables and traditionally chicken liver or sausage).</p>",

In the fish curries of the region a souring agent is always added - in this recipe we're using kokum, a mangosteen fruit that's been salted and dried and gives a subtle fruit acidity to the sauce. The curry is delicious served here with rice and a fresh, crunchy salad known as kosambari.</p>",
