The warming spice mix of oregano, coriander, black pepper and turmeric balances and lifts the sweet notes from the saffron and salmon. To keep the fish in place when turning the kababs on the grill, use \u00bd-inch-wide flat skewers or two thin, round skewers. You can entertain with these skewers or enjoy them on a quiet weeknight, along with dill rice and a side of fresh herbs, or cucumber, tomato and onion salad.</p>",

When applied to food, Bandari indicates the use of spice in a dish. This simple fish dish is rubbed using a special spice mix made with fresh herbs and aromatics that permeates the fish with a wonderful heady flour.</p>",
