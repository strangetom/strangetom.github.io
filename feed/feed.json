This combo of sweet and spicy noodles with shredded chicken is a great one for sharing and especially perfect in the warmer months (although I never let a thing like weather dictate when I eat these) \u2013 a perfectly virtuous snack, finger food or main meal.</p>",

This is a quicker, lighter version using puff pastry to satisfy my inner lazy girl, and perfect for sharing \u2013 but only if you\u2019re in a sharing mood, of course.</p>",

Try it \u2013 it\u2019s one of my favourite recipes in this book and I knew instantly that I had to share it with you.</p>",

Usually I\u2019m a strong advocate for sourdough, but not for this recipe. Fish fingers require something a little fluffier, preferably baked that day and sliced at home into doorstop-style hunks. Team with fancy salted butter \u2013 preferably the stuff that\u2019s golden in hue and has crystals of salt in it.</p>",
