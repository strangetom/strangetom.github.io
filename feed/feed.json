We use store-bought berbere spice, but you can also toast and grind your own homemade blend, especially if you have a well-stocked spice rack. We love this for being a complete meal in a tray, but wouldn\u2019t say no to a big ol\u2019 bowl of greens to eat alongside.</p>",

It's served with creamy garlic yogurt and a hearty tomato-based meat or lentil sauce. As aushak are time-consuming to make, this dish is usually reserved for special occasions. Filling and sealing the aushak is a wonderful opportunity to sit together and prepare this lovely dish in good company.</p>",
