I loved the dish so much that I developed a version with prawns that I often make at home.</p>",

Admittedly, this is not the world\u2019s best-kept secret, as over the years I have written many kebab recipes using every kind of meat. This is my go-to when I want good value and quick, easy results. Lamb neck is completely underrated, especially for quick cooking, although it is equally good for slow-cooked dishes. Once you try this recipe, I know it will become as firm a favourite of yours as it is mine. Serve in wraps or warmed pitta bread with yogurt, sliced onion, tomato, pickled cucumber and coriander leaves, or on a bed of mixed leaves with pomegranate seeds and a good drizzle of pomegranate molasses.</p>",
