My mother made it frequently, so to me it will always have that special taste of comfort and love. It is still something I ask her to make for me because, as is the way with comfort food from our childhood, it always tastes better when made by my mother\u2019s hands.\n\nReally this is a sort of spinach risotto, very similar to Turkish pirin\u00e7li ispanak and Greek spanakorizo but with Balkan elements, specifically the use of sweet paprika and tomatoes. It is generally eaten as a hot meal, sometimes topped with fried eggs. Some like to bake the spinach rice in the oven and top it with eggs, almost like a shakshuka, and some like to add meat. I prefer the simplicity of making it risotto-style, then adding fried or poached eggs for a quick and healthy family meal.</p>",

Feel free to go heavier on the chilli; 1\u20132 chillies, as I suggest, will give you a bit of warmth, but won\u2019t knock your socks off! If you dare to use a second pot, this dish is delicious served with a fried egg on top!</p>",

The latter is the inspiration for this dish, in which a sweet lemony sauce coats crispy fried chicken pieces. This version uses a cheat\u2019s preserved lemon paste and plenty of fresh lemon to brighten it all up. Serve this with the tenderstem broccoli with peanut gochujang dressing and/or fragrant coconut rice.</p>",

Personally, I like to eat a few as they come, but when I\u2019m really hungry, I will toast and split open a pitta bread and shove a few of the koftas inside for a deeply satisfying snack or meal.</p>",

It\u2019s lazy, quick, works really well and you don\u2019t need any oil, as salmon is naturally fatty and delicious. These little salmon bites are something I\u2019ve made time and time again over the years and this method of roasting them at a high temperature ensures you get a little charring on the outside yet perfectly cooked salmon on the inside. Leftovers also make a great addition to your lunchbox the next day.</p>",
