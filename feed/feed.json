The latter is the inspiration for this dish, in which a sweet lemony sauce coats crispy fried chicken pieces. This version uses a cheat\u2019s preserved lemon paste and plenty of fresh lemon to brighten it all up. Serve this with the tenderstem broccoli with peanut gochujang dressing (p. 67) and/or the fragrant coconut rice (p. 196).</p>",

Personally, I like to eat a few as they come, but when I\u2019m really hungry, I will toast and split open a pitta bread and shove a few of the koftas inside for a deeply satisfying snack or meal.</p>",

It\u2019s lazy, quick, works really well and you don\u2019t need any oil, as salmon is naturally fatty and delicious. These little salmon bites are something I\u2019ve made time and time again over the years and this method of roasting them at a high temperature ensures you get a little charring on the outside yet perfectly cooked salmon on the inside. Leftovers also make a great addition to your lunchbox the next day.</p>",

For us, this dish is synonymous with many places in Bombay: Olympia Coffee House and Caf\u00e9 Paris on Colaba Causeway, and Radio Restaurant behind Crawford Market (supposedly where the local Muslim gangsters hang out). A good dish of this keema is guaranteed to transport us back to these places.</p>",
