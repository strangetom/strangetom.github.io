You can pretty much throw anything together with Moroccan spices, dried fruits and nuts and turn it into something beautiful, so this makes an impressive centrepiece \u2013 yet ridiculously easy to make.</p>",

Sadly, a visit to the chippy and trying to lose weight don\u2019t usually work well together, so we thought we\u2019d make our own instead! We\u2019ve crammed as much veg as we can into our version of this popular Aussie dish: even the sauce is made from fresh veggies, which means it\u2019s a great way to make sure you\u2019re getting your five-a-day and is ideal for picky eaters. Serve with rice, chips, or even both!</p>",

There\u2019s quite a kick in our version, but the chilli flakes can be reduced or left out if you prefer. Don\u2019t skimp on the time the bolognese sauce sits on the stove, though. It\u2019s this which gives the dish such depth and makes the house smell like home.</p>",

I wanted something delicious and substantial for those who didn\u2019t eat meat as well as those who did. This recipe went on to become a favourite at pop-up feasts in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. If butternut squash isn\u2019t your thing, it also works beautifully with other types of squash when in season.</p>",
