This recipe gives you the option to cook the doner kebabs on the grill or in the oven. I like using metal skewers here, but you can use bamboo skewers for the grill (be sure to soak them in water for an hour before using). The secret to juicy, flavor chicken doner is in the yogurt marinade, loaded with garlic, citrus, and a few spices. If you have time, let the chicken sit in the marinade for 3 hours up to overnight. But even 30 minutes at room temperature will make a big difference in the flavor of your Turkish kebabs! Cook them on the grill or in the oven - I share tips for both methods!</p>",
