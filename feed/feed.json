Na\u2019ama used to make it two ways. The first was ma\u2019caroneh bil foroun, a kind of Palestinian pasta al forno \u2013 juicy thick macaroni soaked in a meaty tomato sauce. Azam and Sami used to tussle over who got to the crispy bits on top first, then race to see who could slurp the tubes of pasta the fastest. Na\u2019ama\u2019s second pasta staple was lighter and more refreshing, baked this time with yoghurt and nuts. This is our take on that. It can be served warm or at room temperature.</p>",

Tender chunks of lamb (goat, if you\u2019re in Bombay) are braised in a rich and flavoursome gravy then finished with crunchy salli crisp-chips. When served with a hot, buttered chapati and a bowl of kachumber, there are fewer more satisfying lunches. Ours is served with handkerchief-thin roomali roti.</p>",

'Tahdig' is the Persian word referring to the bottom of the pot, where the rice forms a crunchy golden layer of crispy decadence. Also called 'socarrat' in Spain, this scorched rice is the part we look forward to the most.</p>",

Traditionally, they are served as a soup or with a locally made pasta called eriste, but tagliatelle works beautifully.</p>",

The Indian emperor Shah Jahan employed cooks from Persia who used huge volumes of saffron, dried nuts and dried fruits, as well as their signature steam-method that Persians still use to cook rice today. No dish of that era could be more famous than biryani, which is served all over India, Pakistan and the West. This version uses chicken breast, which because it is off the bone, cooks in half the time of a traditional biryani, so makes a great midweek supper.</p>",
