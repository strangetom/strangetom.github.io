In this case, it\u2019s rigatoni in the style of the woodsman. Imagine what a burly, outdoorsy Italian man would eat to warm his bones while out harvesting timber in the forest, or how he might nourish himself before a hunt, and you\u2019ve got this dish: pasta drenched in a cream sauce of pancetta, peas, and mushrooms. The cream gives it warmth, the peas add texture and sweetness, the pancetta delivers a savory note, and the mushrooms\u2014of course\u2014represent the woodsman\u2019s beloved forest. This combination of ingredients offers the perfect burst of energy needed for any difficult task. The dish is earthy, sweet, and powerful, just like you are!</p>",

The key to this is slicing the potatoes very thinly \u2013 it\u2019s possible with a sharp knife but much easier on a mandoline or similar hand-held slicer.</p>",

I first made them in the 1990s when dried tomatoes became hugely trendy and were on every restaurant menu. Although less fashionable now, they remain a flavour bomb, adding instant impact to whatever they come in contact with. The blend of flavours here is almost Mediterranean and works really well with the crisp puff pastry. I like to let the pastries cool just a little before enjoying them, as they are best served warm.</p>",
