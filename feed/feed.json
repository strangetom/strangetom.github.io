Here I use marrowfat peas, which are a creamy and fun alternative to white beans or chickpeas and one that Hodmedod's is growing across parts of the UK. It makes the most delicious pur\u00e9e for the roast carrots, which are spiked with the mild, fruity guajillo chilli. Alternatively, just use chickpeas or butter beans</p>",

The combination of Indian spices, European herbs and Latin American allspice and chilli is also really characteristic of Caribbean cooking and a legacy of the islands being something of a crossroads throughout history.</p>",
