When you see how effortless it is to make your own alcaparrado and how much better it tastes though, you may never go back to store bought.</p>",

Add last night\u2019s dinner, in chopped-up bits, to a basic egg omelet and you have a pretty phenomenal sandwich filler. The olive oil rallies around the beaten egg and gives it a good bubbling fry that pairs well with American cheese. Stuffed into a fresh crusty bread roll, the combination is hard to beat.</p>",
