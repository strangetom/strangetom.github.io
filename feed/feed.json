I also like to serve scallops on a pool of this sauce, or meaty fish like tuna or red mullet, which are improved by the combination of the herbs and the lemony sharpness. Use the black-and-cream-striped bow-shaped pasta for this recipe, if you can find it. It is known as farfalle zebra and is made black by the addition of squid ink.</p>",

These sticky, grilled kebabs are an increasingly popular street food in Korea and are typically served with either a mild soy, or a spicy gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) marinade. Here we've got the spicy option, using chunks of spring onion to alternate with the chicken, which caramelises and crisps up under the grill, served with a refreshing beansprout salad on the side.</p>",

Minty. Perfectly tangy. My Minty Lime Bars recipe is a refreshing, stress-free take on classic lemon squares using fragrant mint and rich lime curd. It is a simple and stress-free dessert recipe that requires only one bowl, a whisk, and less than 10 minutes to prepare!</p>",

The latter is referred to as 'dry' noodles and Bak Chor Mee is a great example. This dish is of Southern China origin, and is popular in both Malaysia and Singapore. Over time it has evolved, and one of the changes is serving it with Sambal - a chilli-based sauce.</p>",

Lamb keema is always cooked with big aromatic spices that make it a very quick way to create dramatic flavours. Keema is also a wonderful vessel for any past-their-best vegetables or half-used tins that are lurking in the back of your fridge, a true more-is-more recipe.</p>",

If you can't get creamed coconut just double-up on the tinned. During the last moments of these exotic sunshine curries, I often throw a handful of roasted nuts to boost the salt and the beach-holiday feel. If you\u2019re not a fan of nuts or don\u2019t have any to hand, you can leave these out without any detriment to the dish.</p>",
