        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Though an American cook (or even a French one) usually adds mayonnaise to the bowl when dressing canned tuna for a sandwich, Italian cooks invariably anoint theirs with olive oil instead. Capers, olives and anchovy often join the festivities; here they are combined with garlic and parsley to make a zesty salsa verde. Choose the best quality Italian or Spanish canned tuna—the extra cost is well worth it. The other essential ingredient is freshly baked bread, like a good crisp baguette or crusty ciabatta roll.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Kale, fennel and noodle soup</title>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This simple, rustic soup is elegantly soothing. It bears a close resemblance to the classic Iranian noodle soup aash e reshteh, which leads me to believe that it found its way into the Palestinian kitchen during the time when the Persian empire ruled over the region 2,500 years ago. Whatever its history, it is a soup I make whenever I want to replenish depleted energy levels, or when I want to offer something restorative at the table, as it is packed with greens and healthy legumes. Feel free to substitute the linguine for another pasta, just be sure to adapt the cooking times according to the packet instructions of your noodle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Iahnie is a way of cooking with just enough liquid for the ingredients to infuse and melt together. It’s a Persian technique brought to the Balkans and north of the Danube by the Ottomans, who used it in meat dishes with beans, pulses and vegetables. In Romania, it is almost always a white bean stew without meat, although I found old recipes that used potatoes, peas and even octopus instead. I serve my iahnie with scovergi, fried cheese flatbreads with crispy edges and a gooey middle, for a more satisfying meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This is a wonderful dish inspired by the Turkish and Tatar cuisines in Dobrogea, where they combine orzo with vermicelli pasta in dishes called botqa. Although most of them are made to accompany meat, I use the recipe with fish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Gazan beef, chickpeas and swiss chard</title>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This sharp and tangy stew is one of the signature dishes of Gaza City and is another recipe adapted from Laila El-Haddad and Maggie Schmitt’s excellent book The Gaza Kitchen. Traditionally made with dill seeds and the roasted red tahini of the city, my version uses caraway seeds and toasted sesame oil, both more readily available in Western supermarkets. Of course, if you happen to come across the former ingredients, don’t hesitate to use them for a more authentic version. In Gaza this is often served at room temperature with warm bread. The accompaniments are up to you; I like it with steamed rice or—if I need something a little more comforting—a generous portion of creamy mashed potato. This tastes even better the next day, so is a great make-ahead dish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Potatoes often feature in peasant or ‘poor man’s’ tagines with onions and garlic and perhaps a few herbs or spices. This roasted variation of a classic poor man’s tagine is delicious served with a fresh tomato or fruit-based salad.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
