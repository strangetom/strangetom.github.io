        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Indian samosas, Hispanic empanadas, Cornish pasties, Bosnian burek: there are so many ways to encase various fillings with pastry before the whole thing gets baked or fried. Sambousek is the Palestinian way. Traditionally they’re fried but we’ve baked ours here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Steaming fish is not only a healthy way to cook it, it also ensures the fish stays moist. Wrapping this salmon up in parcels along with the greens and dressing means that each parcel is bursting with flavour and delicious cooking juices. It makes for a very quick and easy midweek meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;These super-simple pork steaks are pan-fried with leek and onion and coated with a sweet and sticky mustard glaze. Delicious served alongside some fresh green vegetables, or even with a fluffy baked potato, they are super-hearty and comforting. They’re ready in no time at all, which makes them the perfect choice for a midweek meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Sausage lasagna</title>
    <updated>2025-06-22T09:25:35.313075+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:sans-serif;"&gt;Sausage lasagna&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://www.strangerfoods.org/images/sausage-lasagna.webp" style="text-align:center;"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;The right choice of ingredients—and our precise layering technique—make for the most flavorful and structurally sound lasagna we’ve ever had. We wanted an extra-cheesy sausage lasagna that was full of all the flavors of Italian sausage and that held up structurally when served (rather than slipping into a flat mess on the plate like so many others). To make quick work of breaking down the aromatic base of our sausage and tomato sauce, we pulsed fennel, onion, sage, garlic, fennel seeds, and pepper flakes in the food processor, which easily cut the ingredients into small pieces that would soften in the sauce. Next, we boiled our lasagna noodles, slightly undercooking them so that they didn’t turn mushy when they were baked. Then, we puzzled out a precise layering technique to ensure a structurally sound lasagna. By cutting two of the boiled noodles in half, we were able to provide full coverage in the dish for the lower layers of the lasagna (most noodles aren’t quite as long as the baking dish). For the cheesy element, we turned to a combo of creamy mozzarella, flavorful provolone, and supersavory Pecorino Romano. Finally, at the risk of insulting home cooks who have been making their families’ long-established lasagna recipes, we found that we preferred cottage cheese to the traditional ricotta for the creamy element in this lasagna. Ricotta can become gritty, dry, and pasty when baked, while cottage cheese contains more moisture and is more apt to stay pillowy-soft and creamy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;If there’s a vegetable I cannot and will not live without it has to be broccoli rabe. It was a yearly tradition to celebrate this green wonder at a sagra, or local festival, near Naples. When I was a kid, I would eagerly await this fair, as it meant there would be endless fried broccoli rabe available. Walking around town holding a panino with sausage and broccoli rabe was as delightful and exciting to me as going on the merry-go-rounds or roller coaster rides that flooded the sagra. Needless to say, when my Pugliese stepmother, Angela, introduced me to this dish, it quickly became one of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This all-in-one pearl barley dish is like a light risotto: warming and full of flavour. It’s smart enough to serve as part of a sharing table for friends, and comforting enough for a TV dinner with a glass of (red) wine and an episode of Scandal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
