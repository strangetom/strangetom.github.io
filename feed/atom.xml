        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Meatballs weren’t regularly on the family table while I was growing up so a lot of research went into this recipe and there were a few tantrums during the process! Fennel, oregano, lemon and Parmesan are a perfect quartet of flavours. Bring white wine and crème fraîche to the party and you’ve got a pot of delicious, feel-good food.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Jumări de peşte</title>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Jumări means 'fried morsels', usually cuts of meat with a good fat content such as pork scratchings and belly.

They can also be made with carp or catfish, especially using the fatty belly, if the fish is large. I tested the recipe with salmon for practical reasons and the result was very good. It is a dish that can be served on its own as a starter or with drinks, or as a main course with potatoes and salad.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Mâncare de Mazăre şi Bob cu Frigănele</title>
    <updated>2025-02-08T18:32:34.462119+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:sans-serif;"&gt;Mâncare de Mazăre şi Bob cu Frigănele&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://www.strangerfoods.org/images/mancare-de-mazare-si-bob-cu-friganele.webp" style="text-align:center;"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This is a wonderfully light dish, and when made with seasonal peas and broad (fava) beans, it has a delicious sweet flavour. It is served with eggy bread, frigănele, which is a good trick to make a meal more substantial. The aroma that brings everything together is dill, and I know many of you have a love-hate relationship with it, but we love it in Romania. Dill and garden peas are meant to be together. Try it at least once in this combination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The drunken salmon</title>
    <updated>2025-02-08T18:32:34.461638+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:sans-serif;"&gt;The drunken salmon&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://www.strangerfoods.org/images/the-drunken-salmon.webp" style="text-align:center;"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;The Drunken Salmon, while not seemingly Italian, spells pure comfort food for me. My mom really loves whiskey and would often cook with it, infusing her dishes with the amazing earthy flavor of the liquor. I sometimes cook with whiskey, too, like in this boozy homage to my mother. I spike the pan with it just as I would with vodka for penne alla vodka (see my version of this, The Lady in Pink), transferring the woody notes of the whiskey to the cream. The dish feels wintery to me, and I imagine eating it by a fireplace while on a vacation in the Scottish Highlands, or anywhere chilly really. The smoked salmon soaks up the cream with its flavor and makes a gorgeous pink cloak for the penne.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;img src="https://www.strangerfoods.org/images/mashed-potato-balls.webp" style="text-align:center;"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Inspired by the loaded potato skins you often see on pub restaurant menus, these crispy balls of mashed potato have a fluffy cheese, onion and bacon filling. Coated in golden panko breadcrumbs, they’re so easy and satisfying to make. You can crisp them up in the oven or in your air fryer and serve as a tasty snack or side dish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
