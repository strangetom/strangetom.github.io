        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Made with caramelised onions, raisins, cinnamon and sugar, tfaya is the sweet slick that gives a decadent finish to savoury dishes, from tagines to couscous. It’s the cherry on top, to lux out the meal for a special occasion – like the Seven Vegetables Couscous. Catering for the Moroccan sweet tooth, it should have bucket loads of sugar, but my palate (and my dentist) are not so keen. So my version omits all but a pinch of sugar, as I feel the sweetness of the onions is enough. I serve tfaya with a really simple chicken fry, flavoured with dry chermoula and cumin.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Pulled pork chilli</title>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Melt-in-the-mouth pulled pork takes this easy peasy chilli recipe to the next level. Made in the oven or slow cooker, you won’t regret adding this to your midweek menu. Bulked out with vegetables and beans so the small joint of pork goes a long way, this one’s great when you’re watching your pennies as well as your calories. It’s well worth batch-cooking and stashing away the leftovers for a rainy day.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Italian-style tuna sandwich</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:sans-serif;"&gt;Italian-style tuna sandwich&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://www.strangerfoods.org/images/italian-style-tuna-sandwich.webp" style="text-align:center;"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Though an American cook (or even a French one) usually adds mayonnaise to the bowl when dressing canned tuna for a sandwich, Italian cooks invariably anoint theirs with olive oil instead. Capers, olives and anchovy often join the festivities; here they are combined with garlic and parsley to make a zesty salsa verde. Choose the best quality Italian or Spanish canned tuna—the extra cost is well worth it. The other essential ingredient is freshly baked bread, like a good crisp baguette or crusty ciabatta roll.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Kale, fennel and noodle soup</title>
    <updated>2025-09-20T16:41:22.678625+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:sans-serif;"&gt;Kale, fennel and noodle soup&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://www.strangerfoods.org/images/kale-fennel-and-noodle-soup.webp" style="text-align:center;"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This simple, rustic soup is elegantly soothing. It bears a close resemblance to the classic Iranian noodle soup aash e reshteh, which leads me to believe that it found its way into the Palestinian kitchen during the time when the Persian empire ruled over the region 2,500 years ago. Whatever its history, it is a soup I make whenever I want to replenish depleted energy levels, or when I want to offer something restorative at the table, as it is packed with greens and healthy legumes. Feel free to substitute the linguine for another pasta, just be sure to adapt the cooking times according to the packet instructions of your noodle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;Iahnie is a way of cooking with just enough liquid for the ingredients to infuse and melt together. It’s a Persian technique brought to the Balkans and north of the Danube by the Ottomans, who used it in meat dishes with beans, pulses and vegetables. In Romania, it is almost always a white bean stew without meat, although I found old recipes that used potatoes, peas and even octopus instead. I serve my iahnie with scovergi, fried cheese flatbreads with crispy edges and a gooey middle, for a more satisfying meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;p style="font-family:sans-serif;&gt;This is a wonderful dish inspired by the Turkish and Tatar cuisines in Dobrogea, where they combine orzo with vermicelli pasta in dishes called botqa. Although most of them are made to accompany meat, I use the recipe with fish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
