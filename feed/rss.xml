        &lt;h1&gt;Portobello mushrooms with brioche and a poached egg&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Portobello_mushrooms_with_brioche_and_a_poached_egg.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all dishes which involve eggs and toast and getting ready in the morning, this is all about timing. Ideally, you want the mushrooms and toast coming out of the oven at about the same time, to both be warm, and the eggs poached and ready soon after. Get the mushrooms cooking first, put the bread into the oven halfway through, and then get the eggs poaching. This works as well as a starter late in the day as it does in the morning. Use duck eggs for an extra-rich twist..&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Fettuccine with spiced cherry tomato sauce&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Fettuccine_with_spiced_cherry_tomato_sauce.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they are ripe and sweet, buy a big batch of cherry tomatoes, to make double or triple the quantity of sauce. It takes a while to cook - just over an hour - but it keeps in the fridge for 5 days and freezes for up to a month. The ancho chilli adds a lovely smoky richness, but can be replaced by  1/4  tsp sweet smoked paprika, if you have this to hand rather than ancho. Alternatively, if you don't want the kick, leave the chilli out altogether..&lt;/p&gt;
