        &lt;h1&gt;Fishcake tacos with mango, lime and cumin yoghurt&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Fishcake_tacos_with_mango_lime_and_cumin_yoghurt.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making tacos is a really easy and fun way to feed friends. You can prepare everything well in advance - the fishcake mixture (uncooked), the yoghurt, the onion and mango pickle can all be made a day ahead and kept separate in the fridge - then just hop to the stove 5 minutes before everyone wants to eat, cook the fishcakes and heat the tacos. Reheat any leftovers the next day. The dish also works well without the tacos, if you want to eat with a knife and fork..&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Turkey chilli&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Turkey_chilli.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not think of chilli as an easy weeknight dish, but this turkey version from Pierre Franey will change your mind. It's fabulous, it's healthy and it can be ready in about a half hour. A combination of dark and white meat really adds depth and richness of flavor, so try to find a mix, but all white meat (or a mixture of ground beef and turkey) will yield a stellar batch too..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lemony pasta with zucchini and fresh herbs</title>

        &lt;h1&gt;Lemony pasta with zucchini and fresh herbs&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Lemony_pasta_with_zucchini_and_fresh_herbs.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple pasta comes together quickly and makes use of what can sometimes be an overwhelming bumper crop of zucchini and other summer squash come August. Browning the squash in two batches is the only semi-fussy request, and it pays off by giving the squash an almost crunchy texture. Lemon and an abundance of fresh herbs provide brightness to this soon-to-be summer staple. Serve it with a tomato and onion salad dressed with plenty of grassy olive oil..&lt;/p&gt;
