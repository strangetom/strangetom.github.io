        &lt;h1&gt;Coconut-lime shrimp&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Coconut-lime_shrimp.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make this gingery, lightly sweet shrimp stew as tangy and spicy as you like by adjusting the amounts of chile and lime juice. Using full-fat coconut milk gives you the richest and most flavorful dish. But light coconut milk will also work, resulting in something brothier and more souplike. Be sure not to overcook the shrimp. As soon as they turn pink, they're done..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pasta puttanesca</title>

        &lt;h1&gt;Pasta puttanesca&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://strangetom.github.io/images/Pasta_puttanesca.webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are almost as many explanations for the origins of pasta puttanesca as there are ways to make it. Ostensibly a sauce invented and made by prostitutes, it was designed to lure customers with its powerful aroma. Whatever the origin, no better cold-weather pasta sauce has come down to us. Puttanesca can be made completely with ingredients from the larder; in fact, it can be prepared entirely without ingredients that require refrigeration, though a bit of a fresh herb at the end does help. The basis is a garlicky tomato sauce; canned tomatoes are preferable here. This is brought to a high level of flavor by the addition of anchovies, capers and olives. Red pepper flakes make things even better. The whole process is ridiculously easy..&lt;/p&gt;
