					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>To make the puff pastry, first mix the the flour and salt in a large bowl, then chop <b>25</b> g of the butter and rub into the flour with your fingers. Add the lemon juice and <b>140</b> m of cold water and mix with a knife until the mixture is brought together enough to handle. Tip out on to a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic (around <b>5-10</b> minutes). Allow the dough to rest for <b>5</b> minutes.</li>
							<li>Roll out on a floured surface to rectangle of <b>51</b> x <b>17</b> cm (or thereabouts). Roll out the remaining <b>200</b> g butter between sheets of cling film to a rectangle of <b>33</b> x <b>15</b> cm. You'll need to peel off and reapply the cling film regularly to stop it ripping. Working quickly now, peel the top layer of cling film off the butter and flip the butter on to the rolled out dough, covering two-thirds of the length of the dough and also leaving a clear rim around all the edges. Fold the unbuttered dough on to half of the butter and press the edges to seal the butter in. Fold this layer over the remaining butter and press down the edges all around to form a <b>17</b> cm square. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for <b>30</b> minutes.</li>
							<li>Take out of the fridge and roll back out to about <b>51</b> x <b>17</b> cm. Fold up in thirds as before, to make a square. Turn the square through <b>90</b> degrees and roll out to <b>51</b> x <b>17</b> cm again, then fold up as before. Wrap in cling film and chill for another <b>30</b> minutes.</li>
							<li>Repeat the last step, so the pastry has been folded a total of <b>5</b> times. Chill for another <b>30</b> minutes.</li>
							<li>Meanwhile, make the filling. Fry the spring onions in the olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat for <b>2-3</b> minutes. Set aside. Melt the butter in the same pan and stir in the flour to form a thick paste. Gradually add the milk, about <b>50</b> ml at a time, whisking well between each addition. (If you add it all at once, you'll have a lumpy sauce.) Whisk in the wine, then stir in the cheese, mustard and garlic. Allow to cook for a couple of minutes, remembering to make sauce the sauce doesn't dry on the sides of the pan. Add the spring onions, chopped chives, peas and sweetcorn and cook for another <b>2-3</b> minutes. Add the fish and prawns and cook for another <b>5</b> minutes, then season with salt and pepper and scrape the filling into a <b>23</b> x <b>18</b> cm rectangular deep sided pie dish. Leave to cool</li>
							<li>Preheat the oven to <b>220</b>&degC/Gas <b>9</b>. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured work surface to a square roughly <b>30</b> cm and cut off enough <b>3</b> cm wide strips to lay around the rim of the dish. Use plenty of beaten egg to stick these strips around the edge, then brush their tops with more egg. Roll up the remaining pastry on to a rolling pin and lay on top of the pie dish, pressing the top layer of puff down on to the strips, then cut off the excess.</li>
							<li>Gently use a sharp knife to cut small grooves along the side edges of the pastry to expose some of the puff layers. This allows the pastry to puff up more easily when baking.</li>
							<li>Paint with beaten egg and bake in the oven for <b>20-25</b> minutes until golden brown. Serve piping hot with new potatoes and green beans.</li>
